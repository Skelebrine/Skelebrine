# About Me
I am a self-taught, soon-to-be developer. I work on all sorts of wacky stuff like virtual assistants,
websites and web games! I'm also a Roblox developer making more random stuff.

I go by the name 'Skelebrine' or 'Skelebrinium', as my alias. I still have other things to attend to, so updates are less frequent (nobody has unlimited free time ok?).

Unfortunately, there is no way to contact me at the moment. However, I like that because it gives the developer more privacy and more time to work on their projects.
