# About Me
I am a self-taught, soon-to-be developer. I work on all sorts of wacky stuff like virtual assistants,
websites and web games! I'm also a Roblox developer making more random stuff.

I go by the name 'Skelebrine' or 'Skelebrinium', as my alias. I still have other things to attend to, so updates are less frequent (nobody has unlimited free time ok?).

Unfortunately, there is no way to contact me at the moment. However, I like that because it gives the developer more privacy and more time to work on their projects.

## About Licenses
None of my repositories have licenses because I think it gives people more freedom.

No one has to give credit to the original source, but it would be very good to credit the creator, as a sign of respect for the creators that pour their time into these projects.
